# Question: Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: Hello world! Then, the output should be: UPPER CASE 1 LOWER CASE 9

# Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Solution:

s = input()
d={"UPPER CASE":0, "LOWER CASE":0}
for c in s:
    if c.isupper():
        d["UPPER CASE"]+=1
    elif c.islower():
        d["LOWER CASE"]+=1
    else:
        pass
print("UPPER CASE", d["UPPER CASE"])
print("LOWER CASE", d["LOWER CASE"])
